# v1.0.3
## 11/04/2026

1. [](#bugfix)
    * The skeleton shipped a `config/security.yaml` holding a generated `salt`, so every site installed from it started with the same private key. It's removed, and Grav generates a key of its own for each site on install

# v1.0.2
## 10/24/2026

1. [](#improved)
    * Updated for **Grav 2**: the package now includes Admin2 and installs the released version of every plugin and theme
1. [](#bugfix)
    * Fixed the package build so it attaches to the right release and no longer makes a Grav 1 admin package

# v1.0.0
## 02/10/2016

1. [](#new)
    * ChangeLog started...
