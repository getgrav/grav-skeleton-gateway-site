The blockquote is used to indicate the quotation of a large section of text from another source.

>Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:

You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.
